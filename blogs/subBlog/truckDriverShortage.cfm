  	<!---The Truck Driver Shortage: Causes And Long Term Solutions--->
  	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">The Truck Driver Shortage: Causes And Long Term Solutions</h3>
    <p class="g-font-size-18--xs">So they say there's a truck driver shortage?  Yes, it's true... 
    there aren't enough truckers, to fill available truck driving jobs in the U.S. and Canada.
	</p>
    <p class="g-font-size-18--xs">In fact, in 2015, U.S. trucking companies report there are over 30,000 empty seats, 
    needing to be filled. And worse yet, the problem continues to escalate. Predictions are the problem will continue 
    to grow exponentially in the upcoming years... figures say over 200,000 empty seats predicted.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">How on earth can there be a shortage of truck drivers, when commercial driving schools 
	and trucking companies are pumping out newly trained drivers in droves?
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">Statistics tell us there are lots of licensed truck drivers without work.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">So what gives here?
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">North American trucking companies weep and cry the blues about the empty seats in their 
	company trucks and their big losses in revenue. However, I find it mind boggling they are so surprised drivers aren’t 
	lining up to fill these driving jobs.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">The writing has been on the wall for many many years now. Driver turnover rates are in 
	excess of 90%. The numbers don't lie.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">We've got a serious shortage of truckers. There's more demand than ever to move goods by 
	trucks, which creates an even greater shortage. But, there are very clear reasons this issue has become so serious.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">Nothing has been done  to address this looming issue over the past number of years.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">It's only recently, the powers that be and North American carriers are sweating bullets 
	over filling the 30,000+ empty seats… and wondering how to fix the problem.

	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">What Caused the Trucker Shortage?</h3>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	The American and Canadian trucking companies are in this mess and have no one to blame but themselves. Many trucking 
	companies have been guilty of implementing tricks and tactics to squirm out of paying the drivers money they’ve earned. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	The problem really boils down to money...in essence, <b>the distribution of money in the trucking industry</b>... it's not 
	exactly rocket science.
	</p>
	<!---What Caused the Trucker Shortage? End --->
	<br>
	<!---There’s MONEY IN TRUCKING… it’s just not distributed well. --->
	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">There's MONEY IN TRUCKING… it’s just not distributed well.</h3>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	<b>#1. TRUCK DRIVER PAY IS TOO LOW</b>. A truck driving job was once a good paying career. A job that paid on the average, 
	$43,500, 10 years ago, when costs were lower, now pays $41,000.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Trucker wages from the '60's to '80's, were fair. Drivers were able to support their  families on the wages. They were considered 
	middle class wage earners. Not so nowadays.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	The pay is too low to keep up with the cost of living. And meal expenses when on the road? At the end of the day, there's not a 
	whole lot of $$ left in the trucker's pocket.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	<b>#2. FREIGHT MOVES CHEAP</b>. We’ve let the shippers away with this criminal act for a long, long time. <b>Freight rates aren't even close 
	to what they should be. </b>
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Before deregulation ruined the trucking industry, trucking companies, company drivers, owner operators and independent truckers were 
	well paid for their work. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Deregulation, however, destroyed the balance in trucking.  It was great for those paying the freight shipping costs and was a boost 
	for the economy at the time. But, in the long run, <b>deregulation brought about the demise of the trucking industry</b> as well as the economy 
	in North America. Just my humble opinion.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	<b>#3. TOO MANY RULES AND REGULATIONS</b>. To add a few more holes to an already leaky bucket, the trucking industry is becoming more heavily 
	regulated than ever before.  Many drivers are distressed by the electronic log system and the ever changing Hours of Service regs, and 
	are leaving the industry.

	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">Who Is Left To Drive the Trucks?</h3>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	The drivers remaining in the industry are:
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	i) Truckers who like the work and stay with the job in spite of the stringent rules, 
	regulations. For many, it's a job they still love, in spite of the problems.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	ii) Experienced drivers in the better paying positions, close to throwing in the keys 
	and retiring.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	iii) Truckers who can't do the math, won't do the math, and ignore the math... drivers 
	who simply can't afford to quit, scared to quit and are at a loss for an alternate career.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	iv) Foreign workers. Workers from other countries will often take jobs in North America 
	and be satisfied with the wages.

	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">How To Solve the Trucker Shortage</h3>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	I’m sure the very important CEO’s of the big trucking companies think of truck drivers simply 
	as a commodity to be used at the cheapest rates possible.  However, they will need to change 
	their thinking in order to fix this problem.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	1. Redistribution of money in the trucking industry...less into the big pockets of the big 
	players and more into the pockets of the truckers. To increase wages of the front line workers, 
	the CEO's and shareholders would suffer big financial hits. THEIR salaries need to be slashed 
	by a few million dollars each year.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Increasing trucker wages substantially, giving them a decent health benefit plan, and a pension 
	would make a CDL trucking job, much more attractive.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Perhaps consider hourly wages, like other trades and professions. Show them the money and they 
	will line up to fill those 30,000+ driving jobs.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	<b>Hard work deserves a fair wage</b>. But that's just a pipe dream, I guess. To give the North American 
	trucker a <b>pension, won't make a hierarchy of teamster board members rich</b>.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	<b>2. Truck driving need to be a recognized trade</b>. The job ought to be recognized by the governments as an 
	official skilled trade, with decent truck driving training programs and <b>apprentice programs</b>. This could 
	help prevent this problem from happening again in the future. There needs to be more stringent control 
	over the training and wages of truckers.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	<b>3. Freight rates need to increase</b>. Shippers have had it too good for a long, long time now.  It's 
	ludicrous that today's shipping rates are lower than 20-30 years ago, as trucking costs and cost of 
	living index increase.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	In defense of the smaller trucking companies, profit margins may be so slim already, they may not have the money 
	to give more to their workers. So, freight rates need to increase to help put some more  money into the hands of 
	the truckers.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	We need a sharp increase in rates. <b>We need to say NO TO CHEAP FREIGHT.</b>
	</p>

	<!---Future of the Truck Driver Shortage Issue--->
	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">Future of the Truck Driver Shortage Issue</h3>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Presently, there's not enough qualified drivers signing up for these mediocre 
	paying jobs with poor working conditions. And to add insult to injury, truckers 
	ARE NOT TREATED WELL.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Driving a tractor trailer in North America has become a job for immigrants, who will work for 
	less money. They are accustomed to subsistence level living in their home countries, or that is 
	what they need to do, to stay in this country. Wait until the cost of living in the North America 
	catches up with them... <b>then they'll know they can't work for peanuts either.</b>
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	There just aren't enough incentives to keep the skilled, experienced drivers in the industry AND 
	attract new blood.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	If someone could make more money as a <b>heavy equipment operator</b>, driving a bulldozer and be at home 
	every night, <b>why be a trucker?</b>
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	The military can attract workers and they are away often a year at a time. The difference? The pay 
	is good.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	The industry needs to smarten up and pay truckers a fair wage if they want drivers to <b>KEEP ON TRUCKING</b>. 
	Bringing in foreign labour isn't the answer. It's just a band-aid solution.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	More recently, we're seeing companies offering substantial sign on bonuses and increases in mileage rates. 
	It is a step in the right direction, but it's still not enough.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Will driving a truck for a living ever be as good as it once was 25-30 years ago? Sadly, I doubt that it 
	will ever happen. <b>But, it could easily be better than what it is now</b>. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	This creates some obvious problems, and many new truckers feel pressured into promising things they're not sure they can 
	deliver. Don't fall into this trap. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	If the dispatcher doesn't accept your "I'll try my best" response, ask to speak to the safety supervisor.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	This supervisor works for the trucking company. His job is to protect you from unsafe practices and protect the company from 
	potential problems. They will likely resolve the situation very quickly. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	If dispatch is trying to force you to force you to run tired due to crazy scheduling demands, the safety department will by 
	your ally. It also never hurts to have these conversations in writing. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	You can reply via the truck's satellite system by email, saying something like, "I'm tired and can't make this delivery time." 
	These messages are stored on the database. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	And the trucking company could get into serious trouble if a scale master or site auditor saw the message and knew they forced 
	you to run tired anyway.

	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">What to Do If You Still Can't Deal With Your Dispatcher</h3>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	In the trucking industry, there are both good and bad dispatchers. Some of them can be easy to get along with and others can 
	be snakes. And sometimes, despite your best effort, you will come across one who you can't seem to get along with. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	In these situations, you don't have too many choices.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	But you can start by going over their head. First, if the dispatcher's instructions are putting you in danger, go directly to 
	the safety supervisor. That usually clears those matters up immediately.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	But if your dispatcher continues to communicate the same way and repeat the same behaviours, you may have to go over his head. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	My advice to you in any situation is to keep a good record of everything dispatch asks you to do. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	You can even use a tool like an electronic onboard recorder to do so. This way, if anything is questioned by people up the 
	chain of command, you'll have documented proof of the conversations.

	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">Moving On To Another Truck Driving Job</h3>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Keep in mind that you will not always have to deal with bad dispatchers. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	In fact, a good dispatcher is usually the sign of a decent trucking company. And there are many of them out there. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	But if you have dealt with a difficult dispatcher for a long time, and the trucking company is not willing to address 
	the issue, then you may be at a crossroads in your driving career.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Sometimes no matter what you do or say it doesn't work. It's not always possible to find a workable solution to getting 
	along with your dispatcher 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Don't be afraid to take that step if you have to.  A good, long trucking career may require some lateral moves.  
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Know when it's time  to move on!

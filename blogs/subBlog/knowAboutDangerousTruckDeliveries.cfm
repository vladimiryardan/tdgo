    <p class="g-font-size-18--xs">Throughout my trucking driving career, I've seen some wild things and encountered some 
    dangerous situations. There's real danger to driving a rig. If you're a seasoned trucker, then you probably have your 
    own stories to tell. But if you're someone looking to get into the industry then maybe these stories will help give you 
    some perspective and foresight about truck driving dangers.

	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">Is Truck Driving Dangerous?</h3>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	The career of a professional driver can be a very dangerous career and that's part of the reason why truck drivers 
	deserve better pay because they're constantly in situations that could be very dangerous. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	I can recall over the course of the years that I drove a number of times when I thought, "What have I gotten myself 
	into here?"
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Most of these situations revolve around not being familiar with my route, the delivery location or simply being in a 
	dangerous area. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Here are a few of those stories and some words of advice in case you find yourself in a similar situation.

	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">CandleStick Park: Choose Your Fights Carefully</h3>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	I remember accepting a load in the San Francisco area around Candlestick Park.  
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	After calling ahead from Reno to get exact directions into the loading dock. I was running ahead of 
	schedule so I decided it might be good to catch up on some sleep at the dock.  
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	I got a hold of the receiver and I asked, "You know, do you have a good facility down there? Is it okay 
	if I come in tonight and sleep down there backed in against the dock?"
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	And his response was, "Oh no, oh no, don't come in here after dark."
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	I thought that was odd, but it tells me something. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	So, fair enough. I stayed up in Sacramento for the evening and the next day I strolled into what was 
	known as Candlestick Park.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	I was backed into the dock and it was a dead end street. Just at the other end of the dead end street, 
	a couple hundred feet from where I was backed in, there were these young teenage boys standing up on a 
	dirt hill throwing rocks at my truck as I was being unloaded. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	When the dispatcher is assigning you a new load, I recommend you establish a few things up front. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Remember, you're the guy with the specialist licence here. You're the guy with the CDL. You'reAt the 
	time, my truck was a week old. It was its first trip and I was pretty touchy about it. I didn't want 
	dents in it. I never want dents in any of my trucks. These kids were picking up rocks trying to hit 
	my brand new Peterbilt. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	So, I decided to have a talk with these kids to get them to stop. When the owner of the warehouse where 
	I was unloading saw me starting up the hill after these kids, he grabbed me.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	He said, "No, no, don't go up there. The fathers of those kids have Uzis and that's the projects up there. 
	That's a housing project up on that hill."
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	I took his advice and decided to stay and shield my truck as best I could. Luckily for me, the kids didn't 
	have a throwing arm good enough to hit my truck. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
    I finished unloading. I was heading out of there empty and headed down to Salinas to load but I had to 
    drive past this Candlestick Park housing project and it became clear that all these kids knew that I would 
    have to take this road to get out to the highway. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	When I got out to this road they were all standing along the side of the road with rocks waiting for me to 
	come by. I was lucky. I accelerated hard, swung to the other lane which was empty and they missed the truck 
	completely. But I remember thinking, you know, if that guy at the warehouse hadn't warned me, I'd have gone 
	up that hill out to those kids. I would have maybe met some angry father with a gun. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Overall, everything turned out as well as it did. I didn't end up with any dents in my truck and I didn't end 
	up being confronted by an angry father with a gun.

	<!---New Jersey Docks: Communication--->
	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">New Jersey Docks: Communicationk</h3>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	I remember another time I accepted a load of orange juice out of Florida going into the docks in New Jersey.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	I got up into New Jersey and it turned out that where I was taking the orange juice was a Coca-Cola plant. 
	The Longshoreman up there in Jersey were on strike and they were picketing the Coca-Cola plant that I had to 
	go into. The load broker had failed to mention that detail to me. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	I got in the gate in fairly good order because it was before 7:00 AM. They let me in right away but by the 
	time I was empty and getting out of there, it was after 8:00. By this time, the picket line had fully assembled. 
	And I thought, "Oh boy."
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	SI eased my way out through the electronic gate and then the police were there. I squeezed through the picket 
	line but I noticed that a group of six guys got in a car and proceeded to follow me.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	When I left, I was so scared I don't think I stopped for the next 300 or 400 miles just to make sure they'd given 
	up and turned around. I sure didn't want to be confronted by these guys with ax handles in a truck stop parking 
	lot around midnight.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	When I finally stopped I remember thinking that I would have never accepted that load if I had known the Longshoreman 
	were picketing that place. That was a dangerous truck delivery that I would have preferred to pass on.
	</p>

	<!---South Carolina: Don’t Be a Target--->
	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">South Carolina: Don't Be a Target</h3>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Another time I was down in South Carolina and I was delivering a COD load. I thought the standard procedure 
	for something like that is that they gave you a bank draft or a certified check. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	Instead, they took me to the end of the textile warehouse where the cash office was. It was right in the 
	middle of the plant. They then proceeded to count of $2,200 cash in my hand to pay for the COD load with a 
	hundred or so of these factory workers looking on. I remember thinking, "Oh man, I didn't want to be traveling 
	with that much cash." 
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
	It was an uncomfortable feeling. Once again I didn't stop for hundreds of miles after I got out of the plant. 
	I skipped dinner and everything because I thought I wanted to be well out of that area before I stopped in case 
	someone decided to follow me out and retrieved that cash from me.

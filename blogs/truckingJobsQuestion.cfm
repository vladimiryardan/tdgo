	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">How Much Do Trucking Jobs Pay?</h3>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		The rate of pay for CDL driving jobs varies. There's as many different pay packages for trucking jobs as there are trucking companies.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		However, you should know there are some niches in trucking which pay more than others. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		There is an extensive range of driver pay:
		<ul class="g-font-size-18--xs">
			<li >
				<strong>In Canada</strong>, expect anywhere from .35/mile - .55 /mile for driving jobs.
			</li>
			<li >
				<strong>In the U.S.,</strong> pay rates start around .25/ mile and up
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		Most trucking jobs in Canada and the U.S. are paid by the mile.  In addition to the base mileage rate, 
		there's can be compensation pay for drops and pickups, border crossing pay, layovers and waiting time pay.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		Paid mileage rate for trucking jobs will sometimes increase with experience and company loyalty.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		A trucker's salary starts somewhere around $32,000 annually and ranges up to $60,000+.  On average, a trucker 
		in North America makes about $35,000 to $45,000 per year, although this varies greatly, from state to state 
		and province to province.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		When investigating a driving position, find out the average number of miles you can expect month and what you 
		should expect to earn.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		Then do the math. Will you be paid well and fairly compensated for your work? Be sure you understand their pay 
		package.
	</p>
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		Does it pay enough to compensate you for your labour and the fact you'll be away from home? Remember to budget 
		for your meals and other expenses while on the road.

	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		The rate of pay for owner operator trucking jobs varies a great deal.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		Pay depends on the commodity being hauled,  the contractual rate the carrier offers, the location, 
		your experience and most of all, how well you manage your owner operator trucking business.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		Carriers normally offer mileage rates, with paid picks and drops, and various other perks. Some 
		cover bridge and road tolls, while others don't. Some pay waiting time and layovers, others don't.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		There's liability insurance, buy down deductible insurance and hold back costs to consider.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		Shop around and sharpen your pencil. Compare pay packages. Be sure you're going to turn a profit.

	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">

	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		Some truckers are satisfied with company driving jobs for their entire career.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		&#10004; Being a company driver doesn't come with the extra worries and stress, faced by the owner operator - 
		truck maintenance and repair, overweight issues, fines, truck payments etc.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		&#10004; However, some truckers don't like driving company equipment, and would much rather be driving a truck 
		more to their liking.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		&#10004; Some are satisfied to drive whatever they're given. Many truckers who start out as a driver, try their 
		hand at being an owner operator. Sadly, not all are successful.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		&#10004; The profit margin can be lucrative, if you manage your business wisely. If money management and truck 
		worries aren't your thing, stick to being a driver, and leave the worries up to the carrier!
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		&#10004; As a company driver, the money you earn is yours and doesn't belong to the tax man or the bank!

	<h3 class="g-font-size-21--xs g-font-size-25--sm">The Owner Operator</h3>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		Many truckers dream about owning their own rig. There's loads of perks for owner operators 
		if you manage your business wisely.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		&#10004; But, there's loads of responsibilities that go along with owning your own truck - 
		truck payments, fuel costs, replacing equipment, escalating truck expenses, insurance rates, 
		maintenance(which takes money and time) and sometimes struggling to be paid by a carrier or a 
		customer.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		&#10004; If you decide at some point that you're not satisfied with the deal you've made with 
		a carrier, it's not just a simple matter of leaving a carrier you've leased on with, and signing 
		on with another. Chances are you are under a stringent contractual agreement and the company has 
		a hefty hold-back fund of yours.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		&#10004; It's expensive to jump from carrier to carrier as an owner operator.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		Do some careful thinking and research before accepting just any driving job.
	</p>
	
	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		It costs money to leave one job and start another. It's also a waste of time and energy. 
		It can also affect your driving record adversely, so be sure to 'look before you leap'.

	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		In the U.S., one of the options available to get a CDL, is to sign up to a trucking company 
		which offers truck driver training to obtain a CDL, with a job after completing the training

	</p>

	<p class="g-font-size-18--xs">
		These company sponsored training programs are hugely popular because they require very little 
		or no money to get into the program.
		<ul class="g-font-size-18--xs">
			<li >
				Little or no money down to get into the program

		In contrast, private truck driving schools have tuition fees which make them financially out of

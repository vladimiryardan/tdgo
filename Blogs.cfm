    <p>Things You Should Know About Lumpers. Lumping is a service charge that is sometimes used, most commonly, by big grocery store chains. 
    Basically, lumping is when a third-party unloads your freight delivery for you, whether it is stated as part of your job or not. Big 
    grocery chains like lumper services. It saves them millions of dollars in staff and labour annually. Grocery chains are more than happy 
    to allow lumper services in their freight delivery docks for this reason. However, lumping is mostly considered a scam that these chains 
    brush off to the trucking companies. But in the end, it's important that the truck driver, not get stuck with the lumping bill.

    <p>There is a dark side of trucking. It is often brushed aside or not spoken about openly. The trucking industry consists of a huge population 
    of people. Within this population, the majority of the workers are truck drivers who have a stressful risky, often low paying job, live a 
    transient lifestyle and thus are very susceptible to health problems. Some trucking companies and segments of the trucking industry freely 
    take advantage of the truck driver population in various ways. The truck driver is often intimidated by the system and unaware that they are 
    being taken advantage of. Therefore they do nothing in response but take it.

    <p>There's been a mighty strong interest in the poll that ran here at Overdrive earlier this week, 
    something of a follow-up about pressure from whatever external quarter it comes to run counter to the code that so many longtime 
    truck drivers operate by - the very simple and sensibly safe drive when rested, sleep when tired. The poll question asks, 
    specifically, about situations in which violations of that code may not be so cut and dried but what is abundantly clear is 
    other regulatory violations would be the result of caving to wherever the pressure is coming from, i.e. a shipper/receiver, 
    broker or carrier operations.

    <p>At some point in time, everyone has driven by a semi-truck as they ventured down a highway. These mammoth vehicles have become so 
    ubiquitous that it is sometimes taken for granted, but they have an integral role in the economy. It is estimated that trucks carry up 
    to 70% of all inland freight across America. Freight volumes are also expected to increase by 29% over the next eleven years, which is 
    why the current dilemma of the waning number of truck drivers is alarming. There is an estimated shortage of 35,000 to 40,000 drivers 
    across the country, and experts claim that it will be a long time before that problem is resolved.

    <p>Emails, messages and phone calls are coming at you left and right, from customers and truck drivers. You need to make sudden changes 
    to routes based on construction or bad weather. And your driver might not make it in time. In those moments, it's easy for a dispatcher 
    to get stressed out. A dispatcher monitors where trucks are located, checks on how the runs are going, deals with customers, finds the 
    next load assignments for the current truck, and much more. You might be a dispatcher for owner operators, or for company drivers. Since 
    the job is fast-paced and continually changing, readiness and adaptability are required characteristics of a prospective truck dispatcher.

    <p>The first thing we need to define is what dispatching trucks is all about. You can easily compare this to the air traffic control that 
    is required when planes take off. The dispatcher is the one that is going to be controlling the movement and the Schedule of the trucks. 
    In this article we are going to cover the basics about what it takes to be a truck dispatcher and how you can make sure that you can keep 
    everything under control in order for your business to move forward successfully.

    <p>I have been in the trucking industry for 16 years now. Over my 16 years I have worn many hats. I have worked for companies that provided 
    freight transportation in various ways. I started out as an auditor for Waste Management of Richmond, Virginia. This was a commercial company 
    that dealt with trash and recycle but it started my love for trucking and the trucking industry. While at Waste Management, I was able to ride 
    with all the drivers on their routes. I was able to get a feel and love for the road. My main job there was to observe the routes and time of 
    the pickups. I was hired to save the company money.

    <p>Last time we talked about the relationship between the Broker and Dispatch, now let's talk about the relationship between the dispatcher and 
    the driver. Some may say there isn't much to say, but I greatly disagree. Your relationship with the driver is very important, and can make or 
    break your day. What you should know about the driver is that they are in there truck for hours at a time. Most of them are single drivers and 
    so they are not just in their trucks for hours at a time but also by their self. Now many may say that that's what they signed up for. Some may 
    say well I'm not in a truck but I am along at work by myself for long hours at a time. None of these things matter. The thing that matters the 
    most is the sacrifice that they give on the job.

    <p>In the trucking industry, we talk a lot about the driver retention problem and potential ways to solve it, but one aspect not often discussed 
    is the key role that dispatchers can play in this important issue. The dispatcher shapes the driver's experience, and therefore can significantly 
    improve it. According to a study by Stay Metrics, high dispatcher satisfaction is associated with 16 percent lower early driver turnover. This is 
    why we've put together a cheat sheet for dispatchers to help guide decision-making and simplify complicated workflows. This can create a more seamless 
    and less stressful experience for both dispatchers and drivers.

    <p>With the increasing competition in the carrier service, the truck operators are finding it a little hard to get a good income from the 
    dispatching services. But when you can have hot shot loads, you may be able to earn a little more but the quality of dispatch is also needed 
    to be high and you need to be accurate on time. The advantage with the hot shot load is that you can easily make use of only one truck in 
    combination with several carriers to generate more income while spending lesser amount of money on the fuel. There are some companies that 
    might provide you with hot shot loads at some commission charges but the profit you earn with these more than makes up for it.

    for the movement of most goods between the U.S and Canada and realized about $67 billion of revenues back in 2005. Although truck driving is

    manage the flow of the freight from point A to point B. They attempt to minimize the truck's empty miles and maximize the company's profits. 
    That's the dispatcher's job and what they are paid to do. Years ago in the trucking industry, dispatchers were well seasoned, experienced 
    ex-truck drivers. They understood the trucking industry. Today, dispatchers are often young people highly skilled with computers! They're often 
    fresh out of community college with a crash course in dispatch software management.
